The world of sports is often fertile ground for the exploration of unexpected and sometimes downright weed-y correlations. In this paper, we delve into the "grassroots" influence of outdoor power equipment mechanics on the final match score difference in the Volkswagen Challenger Set. Our investigation was inspired by a desire to uncover the mow-tivating factors behind the outcomes of professional tennis tournaments. As we all know, the world of sports is a cutthroat environment, and it seems that the influence of grassroot-level professionals extends beyond the green fields and into the green courts.<br />
<br />
While it may seem like a stretch, our data-driven analysis has unearthed a surprising correlation between these disparate variables. With a correlation coefficient of 0.9293987 and p < 0.01 for the years 2003 to 2012, the numbers suggest a strong association between the two. Who would have thought that the number of outdoor power equipment mechanics in Pennsylvania could have such a leaf-turning impact on the final match score differences in a tennis tournament?<br />
<br />
This research sheds new light on the interplay between seemingly unrelated industries and their impact on sporting events. It also emphasizes the formidable influence of those working at the grassroot level, and raises questions about the grass-is-greener phenomenon in the world of professional sports.

[[LITERATURE REVIEW]]<br />
<br />
    <br><br><b>ChatGPT:</b><br>[[LITERATURE REVIEW]]<br />
<br />
The present literature review aims to critically examine the existing scholarship surrounding the unforeseen association between the final match score difference in the Volkswagen Challenger Set and the number of outdoor power equipment mechanics in Pennsylvania. While the topic may initially appear as dry as a summer drought, we aim to unearth the fertile ground of unexpected connections in the world of sports and professional services.<br />
<br />
Smith et al. (2010) were the first to explore this peculiar correlation, shedding light on the hidden influence of grassroot-level professionals on high-stakes sporting events. Drawing on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the International Tennis Federation, the authors find a startlingly high correlation coefficient, prompting them to suggest the presence of a "lawnmower effect" on tournament outcomes. Their findings provide a solid foundation for our understanding of the overlap between the lawn care industry and professional sports.<br />
<br />
Doe (2014) expanded on this research by examining the role of outdoor power equipment mechanics in shaping tournament dynamics. Through rigorous statistical analysis and qualitative interviews with industry professionals, the author highlights the cutthroat competition within the industry and its potential spillover effects onto the competitive landscape of professional tennis. Doe's work adds depth to the emerging discourse on the grassroot-level forces shaping the world of sports.<br />
<br />
In "The Lawn Chronicles: A Comprehensive History of Grass and Its Enthusiasts," Lorem and Ipsum (2008) take a broader look at the intersection of lawn care and societal influences. While not directly related to our specific research question, their insights into the cultural significance of green spaces and grass maintenance offer a broader context for understanding the underexplored connections between the lawn care industry and professional sports.<br />

Our findings suggest that there may be a cutthroat competition in the lawn care industry that spills over into the world of professional tennis tournaments. Additionally, our research sheds new light on the often-overlooked influence of grassroot-level professionals on the outcomes of high-stakes sporting events.<br><br><b>ChatGPT:</b><br><br />

<b>Correlation r = 0.9293987</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient">Pearson correlation coefficient</a>)
<br>Correlation is a measure of how much the variables move together. If it is 0.99, when one goes up the other goes up.  If it is 0.02, the connection is very weak or non-existent.  If it is -0.99, then when one goes up the other goes down.  If it is 1.00, you probably messed up your correlation function.
<br><br>
<b>r<sup>2</sup> = 0.8637820</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination">Coefficient of determination</a>)
<br>
This means <b>86.4% </b> of the change in the one variable <i>(i.e., The number of outdoor power equipment mechanics in Pennsylvania)</i> is predictable based on the change in the other <i>(i.e., Final Match Score Difference in the Volkswagen Challenger Set)</i> over the 10 years from 2003 through 2012.

More specifically the <i>p</i>-value is a measure of how probable it is that we would randomly find a result this extreme <b>if we had only tested one pair of variables one time</b>.
<br><br>But I am a p-villain.  I absolutely did <b>not</b> test only one pair of variables one time. I correlated hundreds of millions of pairs of variables.

The confidence interval is an estimate the range of the value of the correlation coefficient, using the correlation itself as an input. The values are meant to be the low and high end of the correlation coefficient with 95% confidence.<br><br>This one is a bit more complciated than the other calculations, but I include it because many people have been pushing for confidence intervals instead of p-value calculations (for example: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1906559">NEJM</a>.  However, if you are dredging data, you can reliably find yourself in the 5%.  That's my goal!

If I were being very sneaky, I could trim years from the beginning or end of the datasets to increase the correlation on some pairs of variables.  I don't do that because there are already plenty of correlations in my database without monkeying with the years.<br><br>
Still, sometimes one of the variables has more years of data available than the other.  This page only shows the overlapping years.  To see all the years, click on "See what else correlates with..." link above.

<li><b>Data dredging:</b> I have 25,153 variables in my database.  I compare all these variables against each other to find ones that randomly match up.  That's 632,673,409 correlation calculations!  This is called “data dredging.”  Instead of starting with a hypothesis and testing it, I instead abused the data to see what correlations shake out. It’s a dangerous way to go about analysis, because any sufficiently large dataset will yield strong correlations completely at random.</li>
<li><b>Lack of causal connection: </b> There is probably<span><input type="checkbox" id="cc2" /><label for="cc2"><sup>Note</sup></label>
<span class="genai-block">
Because these pages are automatically generated, it's possible that the two variables you are viewing are in fact causually related.  I take steps to prevent the obvious ones from showing on the site (I don't let data about the weather in one city correlate with the weather in a neighboring city, for example), but sometimes they still pop up.  If they are related, cool! You found a loophole.
<br></span></span> no direct connection between these variables, despite what the AI says above.   This is exacerbated by the fact that I used "Years" as the base variable.  Lots of things happen in a year that are not related to each other!  Most studies would use something like "one person" in stead of "one year" to be the "thing" studied.
</li>
<li><b>Observations not independent: </b> For many variables, sequential years are not independent of each other.  If a population of people is continuously doing something every day, there is no reason to think they would suddenly <i>change</i> how they are doing that thing on January 1.  A simple<span><input type="checkbox" id="cc2ni" /><label for="cc2ni"><sup>Note</sup></label>
<span class="genai-block">
Personally I don't find any p-value calculation to be 'simple,' but you know what I mean. 
<br></span></span> <i>p</i>-value calculation does not take this into account, so mathematically it appears less probable than it really is.

<li><b>Y-axis doesn't start at zero: </b>I truncated the Y-axes of the graph above.  I also used a line graph, which makes the visual connection stand out more than it deserves.
<span><input type="checkbox" id="cc22" /><label for="cc22"><sup>Note</sup></label>
<span class="genai-block">
Nothing against line graphs.  They are great at telling a story when you have linear data!  But visually it is deceptive because the only data is at the <i>points</i> on the graph, not the <i>lines</i> on the graph.  In between each point, the data could have been doing anything.  Like going for a random walk by itself!

  Mathematically what I showed is true, but it is intentionally misleading.  Below is the same chart but with both Y-axes starting at zero.</li>

<b>Step 1: </b><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download and install Python</a> on your computer.
<br><br>
<b>Step 2: </b>Open a plaintext editor like Notepad and paste the code below into it.
<br><br>
<b>Step 3: </b>Save the file as "calculate_correlation.py" in a place you will remember, like your desktop.  Copy the file location to your clipboard. On Windows, you can right-click the file and click "Properties," and then copy what comes after "Location:"  As an example, on my computer the location is "C:\Users\tyler\Desktop"
<br><br>
<b>Step 4: </b>Open a <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Command_Prompt/Open">command line window</a>.  For example, by pressing start and typing "cmd" and them pressing enter.
<br><br>
<b>Step 5: </b>Install the required modules by typing "pip install numpy", then pressing enter, then typing "pip install scipy", then pressing enter.
<br><br>
<b>Step 6: </b>Navigate to the location where you saved the Python file by using the "cd" command.  For example, I would type "cd C:\Users\tyler\Desktop" and push enter.

For the record, I am just one person.  Tyler Vigen, he/him/his. I do have degrees, but they should not go after my name unless you want to annoy my wife.  If that is your goal, then go ahead and cite me as "Tyler Vigen, A.A. A.A.S. B.A. J.D." Otherwise it is just "Tyler Vigen."<br><br>
When spoken, my last name is pronounced "vegan," like I don't eat meat.<br><br>

        <span class="genai-block">The image linked here is a Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG).  It is the highest resolution that is possible to achieve.  It scales up <i>beyond the size of the observable universe</i> without pixelating.  You do not need to email me asking if I have a higher resolution image. I do not.  The physical limitations of our universe prevent me from providing you with an image that is any higher resolution than this one.<br><br>If you insert it into a PowerPoint presentation (a tool well-known for managing things that are the scale of the universe), you can right-click &gt; "Ungroup" or "Create Shape" and then edit the lines and text directly.  You can also change the colors this way.<br><br>Alternatively you can use a tool like <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.<br></span></span></li>
